      <p>I enjoy the simple things in life. The power of a good laugh, jamming out to an old mixed-tape, seeing other people happy...
        I very much enjoy helping others. I worked as a Neuro ICU nurse for about 2-3 years and then switched to pediatrics for another 2 years.
        I really enjoyed both fields, but found I couldn't stop bringing the work home with me. I then realized I could help people in other ways
        and after doing some soul-searching, re-evaluating my interests, and reviewing what qualities I'm strong at, programming seemed to fit
        the bill. It also helped that my fiance is a programmer and could give me some great insight into the career. My interest in the career
        grew rapidly! I love to see what I can accomplish and what I can build. It's amazing to see some of the things you can do with programming.</p>

      <p>Aside from career choices, I moved to Denver Colorado from Phoenix Arizona towards the end of 2012. I had lived in Arizona for the previous
        20 years and was dying for a change in scenery. I love the outdoors and being active, but it was difficult to be as active as I wanted to be
        when it's 120 degrees outside for 8 months of the year... I randomly decided on Denver and could not have picked a better city. I love the
        culture, I love the scenery, and I met my future hubby just 6 weeks after moving here. I've listed some of my favorite hobbies below,
        which I think gives a great summary as to why I love Denver and why I might love programming.
      </p>
